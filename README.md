# TypeScript Playground

Run TS code to check how it's working, install/remove libraries.

```keeper``` function is required to keep ```ts-node-dev``` from quitting. In this case it is always running and reloads on code change.

To start, use ```npm run dev``` mode. If you want to run in _production_ mode - ```npm run dev:prod```.

Playground has support for ESlint for TypeScript and Jest for testing.
